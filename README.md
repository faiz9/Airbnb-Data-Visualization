Summary:
My friend Philip is starting an Airbnb business & he needs to know the where to buy the property to charge the highest price, best times to live in the property and rent it out, understand how many bedrooms he needs to beat his competition. He needs this information to optimize his business for profit. 

Use Case 1: Price By Zipcode; 
Actors: Philip, Location & Price. 

Description: Philip needs to find the best location to charge the most amount for profit. From the data, we found a property in the 98134 zipcode has the highest price charged at $206 on average. 

Use Case 2: Best times for listings. 
Actors: Philip, Calender

Description: Philip plan on living on the property he will list on Airbnb but wants to know the best times during the year to list the prpoerty for rent. Through the data, we observe the best time to list the property on Airbnb is over the summer through the end of the year especially during holidays as more people are traveling. 

Use Case 3: Competition for the bedrooms. 
Actors: Philip, Competition, Bedrooms.

Description: Phil wants the data on his competition to understand how many listings have what amount of bedrooms available and based on this data which property brings the highest revenues. In the data findings, we discover the higher amount of the bedrooms the lesser the competition and higher amount of bedrooms brings in more profit. However, it is for Philip to figure out if there is demand for 4, 5, and 6 bedroom listings?
